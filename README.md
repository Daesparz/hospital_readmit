# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction
 
In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate
2. Construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of your own

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- This notebook loads [cms_hospital_readmissions.csv](./hospital_readmit/cms_hospital_readmissions.csv).
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- Run Anaconda Navigator and launch a jupyter notebook and open the file [inferential_statistics_exercise](./sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_3.ipynb)

Packages applied in this project (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn) do not require installation (default packages in anaconda). They only need to be imported in the notebook.
